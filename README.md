This respository is for all NodeBots Day events being run in Australia and contains lsetup guides and information around simple bots and resources that can be used on the day.


## Things to do before the day

### Setup your machine

If you can download and install all your software prerequisites it will mean you're up and running that much faster. [Our setup guide should get you up and running](setup.md) however if you run into any problems, our friendly NodeBoteers will give you a hand on the day.

### Buy Hardware Components (if you have not purchased a kit)

If you're keen on building a simple robot you can take home with you then you'll need some components. [We've got a handy list here of what you need and where you can get it.](https://github.com/nodebotsau/simplebot#materials-needed)

## Things to do on the day

- Bring your laptop.
- Bring any extra electronics components you want to use.
