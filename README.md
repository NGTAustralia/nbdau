# NodeBots Day Resources

This respository is for all NodeBots Day events being run in Australia and contains location information as well as setup guides and information around simple bots and resources that can be used on the day.

## Hosting an event

Looking to bring NodeBots day to a place near to you - get in touch with Andrew Fisher (ajfisher.td at gmail) and he will help you arrange it.

## Upcoming Events:

NodeBots at CampJS III - weekend of 23 - 26 May, 2014, NoodeBots workshops will be conducted on the Saturday and Sunday with plenty of hacking time in between.

NodeBots Hacking - Hack Melbourne 2nd and 4th Wednesdays of the Month for ongoing hacking.

## Things to do before the day

If you can download and install all your software prerequisites it will mean you're up and running that much faster. [Our setup guide should get you up and running](setup.md) however if you run into any problems, our friendly NodeBoteers willgive you a hand on the day.

If you're keen on building a simple robot you can take home with you then you'll need some components. [We've got a handy list here of what you need and where you can get it.](simplebot)
