# NodeBots Day

This respository is for all NodeBots Day events being run in Australia and contains setup guides and information around simple bots and resources that can be used on the day.


## Things to do before the day

- **Setup your machine:** Download and install all your software prerequisites so you can be up and running much faster. [Our setup guide should get you up and running](setup.md) however if you run into any problems, our friendly NodeBoteers will give you a hand on the day.

- **Buy Hardware Components (if you didn't purchase a kit):** If you're keen on building a simple robot you can take home with you then you'll need some components. [We've got a handy list here of what you need and where you can get it.](https://github.com/nodebotsau/simplebot#materials-needed)

- **Learn some basic electronics:** Check out our [handy guide](Nodebots%20electronics%20primer.pdf) if you want to learn (or freshen up) about electronics.

## Things to do on the day

- Bring your laptop.
- Bring any extra electronics components you want to use.
- [Join our slack channel](http://invite.nodebots.au) if you havent already!
